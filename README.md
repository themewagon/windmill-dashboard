## Getting Started

1. Clone from GitHub 
```
https://github.com/themewagon/windmill-dashboard.git
```
2. Install Dependencies
```
npm i
```
3. Build CSS (optional, pre-built CSS is in `public/assets/css/`)
```
npm run build
```
4. Run locally (e.g. `npx serve public` or open `public/index.html` in a browser)

### Deploy to GitHub Pages (base URL: `/windmill-dashboard/`)

The dashboard is static HTML in `public/`. To serve it at `https://themewagon.github.io/windmill-dashboard/`:

1. In the repo go to **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
3. Push to `main` (or run the workflow manually from the Actions tab). The workflow builds Tailwind CSS and deploys the `public/` folder.

All links use relative paths, so they work correctly under the `/windmill-dashboard/` base path.
